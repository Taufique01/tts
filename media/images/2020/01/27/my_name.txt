My name is rafi.I am from bangladesh. What is your name?Where are you from? What is you hobby.   lectures, a reuse distance D, reuse factor Q, and parameter N, which describes a number of cells in cluster, have been used to obtain the carrier-to-interference (C/I) ratio: 1 Q= C = I D R D0  0 M D  k =1 k k Where   is the factor of signal strength attenuation with distance between BS and any subscriber, M is a number of interfering cells in the cellular pattern. The following simplifications are used: - First tier interference (M=6); equal distance from interfering BSs (Dk=D); equal path-loss exponent (   k =   0 =   ). That is, D0 C = I 6 D  Maximal interference can be obtain if D0=R, the system requirements for proper detection is to achieve (C/I)min. 1  R   6  D C     I   min   C   Q =   6        I   min  Radio Capacity: Radio capacity can be defined as: m= Bt radio ch./cell Bc N from Q = 3 N we can obtain: m= m= Bt = Q2  6 Bc Bc    / 2 3 3 Bt Bc 2 C   3   I   min 2 Bt C        I   min  2 / for   = 4    C         I   min    C    Q =   6          I   min     Radio Capacity: Radio capacity can be defined as: m= Bt radio ch./cell Bc N from Q = 3 N we can obtain: m= m= Bt = Q2   6 Bc Bc    / 2 3  3 Bt Bc 2 C      3   I   min 2 Bt  C            I   min   2 /  for   = 4
